# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-using-Arduino

The Obstacle Avoidance Robot using Arduino is a popular project in robotics where a robot is designed to navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles in its path. Below is a project description for creating an Obstacle Avoidance Robot:

# Components Needed:

Arduino Board: Acts as the main controller.
Motor Driver Module: To control the motors for movement.
DC Motors: Typically two motors are used for driving and steering.
Ultrasonic Sensor: To detect obstacles in front of the robot.
Chassis: The body of the robot where motors are mounted.
Wheels and Casters: Provide movement and stability to the robot.
Battery Pack: To power the motors and Arduino.

# Circuit Diagram:

Connect the motor driver module to the Arduino. Typically, two PWM pins are used for speed control and two digital pins for direction control per motor.
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino. This usually requires one pin for triggering the sensor and another for receiving the echo.
Power the motor driver module, ultrasonic sensor, and Arduino with the battery pack.

# Programming:
Arduino Code: Write code to read data from the ultrasonic sensor and control the motors to navigate around obstacles.

# Assembly:

Assemble the chassis and mount the motors, wheels, and casters.
Mount the Arduino, motor driver module, and ultrasonic sensor on the chassis securely.
Connect the motors to the motor driver module and power connections.
Place the battery pack in a suitable location on the chassis and connect it to power the motors and Arduino.

# Testing and Troubleshooting:
Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino board.
Test the robot's movements by placing obstacles in its path and observing if it successfully avoids them.
Troubleshoot any issues with obstacle detection or motor control as necessary.

# Enhancements:

Implement more advanced obstacle avoidance algorithms for smoother navigation.
Integrate additional sensors such as infrared or laser sensors for detecting obstacles from different angles.
Add features like speed control, line following, or remote control capabilities.

By following these steps, you can create an Obstacle Avoidance Robot project that navigates its environment autonomously while avoiding obstacles. It's a fun and educational project that combines electronics, programming, and mechanical assembly skills.
